## 240lx Labs.

Overview:
  - We generally alternate between a couple technical labs and then
    something fun.  Often if there is a hard topic we will do a lab on it,
    wait a couple weeks and then do another so that it can sink in more
    ("spaced repetition").
  - The first part of the class usually spends a bit more time per lab
    since there are people that haven't taken 140e.  The latter portion
    of the class speeds up.
  - For those with high executive function, there is an initial list of
    possible [final projects](./final-projects/README.md).
  - For those with low executive function, there are some
    [lab-memes](lab-memes).

Many more labs TBA:
   - [1-mailboxes](1-mailboxes): using the GPU mailbox interface
     to do fun hacks such as overclocking the pi.
   - [2-dynamic-code-gen](2-dynamic-code-gen/): how 
     to generate executable machine code at runtime and how to 
     use this trick to do neat stuff.  
   - [3-ir](3-ir): simple IR remote control reverse engineering.
   - [4-jit-derive](4-jit-derive): reverse engineer machine code encodings
     using the assembler.
   - [5-malloc+gc](5-malloc+gc): build a Boehm style garbage collector.
   - [6-debug-alloc](6-debug-alloc): build a simple debugging allocator.
     We use this for our later checking tools.
   - [7-imu-i2c](7-imu-i2c): another fun device lab. Write the driver
     for an MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope from the data sheet.
   - [8-i2c](8-i2c): write an I2C driver.  Now all the code for the 
     for the previous MPU lab is yours!
   - [9-profiler](9-profiler): use single-step debug hardware to build
     an exact instruction profiler.  Extend it with sleazy tricks
     to do cycle counting.
   - [10-pmu](10-pmu): use the arm performance counters to figure
     out interesting things.
   - [11-memcheck-trap](11-memcheck-trap): use domain protection and 
     debugging hardware to automatically trap every memory access.
   - [12-memcheck-trap-II](12-memcheck-trap-II): use the memory tracer
     you built and your debug allocator to make a simple purify-style 
     memory checker in a couple hundred lines of code.
   - [13-ws2812b](13-ws2812b): use the timing knowledge you gained from 
     the lab 10 (PMU) to write a addressable light array driver.
   - [14-stepper-motor](14-stepper-motor):  write a driver for
     the A4988 board and use it to drive a nema 17 stepper motor.  You
     can use this to build stuff all the way from robots to music.

As an unual step we're closing out with three student-made labs!

   - [15-elf-dynamic-linker](15-elf-dynamic-linker):  Stuart Sul's lab
     on building a ELF dynamic linker.
   - [16-gpu](16-gpu): Rohan Chanani and Asanshay Gupta's lab 
     on using the pi's GPU (videocore IV) bare metal.
   - [17-pico-2](17-pico-2): Max Cura's lab on bare metal booting 
     the pico 2 in riscv mode.

Some extra device labs:
   - [dev-keyboard-4x4](dev-keyboard-4x4): quick lab for a standard 4x4 
     (16 button) matrix keyboard.  

Since spring quarter is rough, we'll provide some extra optional labs
that people can do instead of a final project.

   - [opt-keyboard-4x4](dev-keyboard-4x4): quick lab for a standard 4x4 
     (16 button) matrix keyboard.
