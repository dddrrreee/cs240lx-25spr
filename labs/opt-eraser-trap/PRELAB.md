### Prelab for trap based Eraser

This weeks labs replicate research papers.  So you should
read them.  The one for today's lab is the original Eraser paper:

  - [./docs/cs240-annot-eraser-tocs.pdf](./docs/cs240-annot-eraser-tocs.pdf)

Reading notes to help:

  - [./docs/eraser-notes.txt](./docs/eraser-notes.txt)
  

You should read it at least a couple of times thoroughly.  Building
it will be a lot easier if you understand it :)
